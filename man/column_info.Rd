\title{Column Information with Grouping}
\usage{
column_info(df, corr_variable = NULL, by = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{corr_variable}{An optional string specifying the name of a column with which to calculate
correlations for numeric columns. This parameter is ignored for non-numeric columns.}

\item{by}{An optional character vector specifying one or two column names by which to group the data before analysis.
If provided, statistics are calculated within each group, and the output includes a \code{Grouped_by} column
showing the grouping variables and their values for each row.}

\item{dt}{A data.table or data frame to analyze.}
}
\value{
Returns a data.table containing statistics for each column in the input data.
For numeric columns, statistics include the mean, standard deviation, maximum, minimum, and number of observations.
The type of variable (e.g., continuous, discrete) and distribution characteristics are also provided.
If \code{corr_variable} is specified, the correlation of each numeric column with the specified column is included.
The output includes a \code{Grouped_by} column if the data is grouped.
}
\description{
Analyzes a given data table or frame, providing detailed information about each column.
The function calculates statistics like mean, standard deviation, maximum, and minimum values for numeric columns.
For categorical columns, it identifies the type and distribution characteristics. Optionally,
it calculates correlations with a specified column. It supports grouping by one or two variables,
presenting grouped analyses within the output.
}
\details{
This function is particularly useful for exploratory data analysis, allowing for a quick overview
of the data structure, including basic statistics and correlations. Grouping functionality enables
more granular analysis based on specified segments of the data.

\examples{
\dontrun{
  library(data.table)
  dt <- data.table(id = 1:4, 
                   score = c(23, 42, 16, 8), 
                   category = factor(c("A", "B", "A", "B")), 
                   value = rnorm(4))
  # Basic usage without grouping
  column_info(dt, corr_variable = "score")
  
  # With grouping by a single variable
  column_info(dt, by = "category")
  
  # Grouping by two variables and calculating correlation
  column_info(dt, corr_variable = "score", by = c("category", "id"))
}
