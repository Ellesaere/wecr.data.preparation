\title{Check if Character Vector is Mostly Numeric}
\usage{
conv_to_num_check(z, tolerance = 0.95)
}
\arguments{
\item{z}{A character vector to be evaluated for numeric convertibility.}

\item{tolerance}{A numeric value between 0 and 1 indicating the proportion of elements in \code{z}
that need to be convertible to numeric for the vector to be considered numeric.
Defaults to 0.95.}
}
\value{
A logical value; \code{TRUE} if the proportion of numeric-convertible elements in \code{z}
meets or exceeds the \code{tolerance} threshold, otherwise \code{FALSE}.
}
\description{
Determines whether a character vector can predominantly be converted to numeric based on a tolerance threshold.
This is useful for preprocessing and cleaning data, ensuring that character vectors
that represent numeric values are correctly identified and potentially converted to numeric type.

\dontrun{
  vec <- c("123", "456", "abc", "789")
  conv_to_num_check(vec) # Expected to return FALSE
  vec <- c("123", "456", "789", "1000.5")
  conv_to_num_check(vec) # Expected to return TRUE
